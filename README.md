I created a fully responsive Movie Search App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, powered by the OMDb API.

✨ Features:
🔍 Search for movies by name (e.g., Titanic, Kushi, Avengers)
🎞 Displays movie posters, release year, and type
📋 View full movie details (genre, plot, actors, IMDB rating) in a modal popup
📱 Mobile-friendly responsive layout

🛠️ Technologies Used:
✔ HTML5 | CSS3 | JavaScript (ES6)
✔ API integration using OMDb
✔ DOM manipulation & modal design

Excited to keep learning and building more! 💻
